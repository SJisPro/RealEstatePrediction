# **Real Estate Price Prediction**

A web application that predicts real estate prices based on user inputs such as location, size, and other relevant features. The project uses a machine learning model built with **scikit-learn** for price prediction, a **Flask** backend to serve the model, and a user-friendly frontend created with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## **About the Project**  
This project predicts real estate prices using a **Linear Regression** model trained on relevant data. The application allows users to input property details through a simple interface and provides accurate price predictions in real time.  

The goal of the project is to demonstrate the integration of machine learning, backend, and frontend technologies to build a complete, user-facing application.

---

## **Features**  
- Predict property prices based on key attributes (e.g., location, size, number of rooms).  
- Simple and intuitive web interface for user interaction.  
- Real-time integration between the frontend and backend.  
- Lightweight and efficient deployment using Flask.

---

## **Tech Stack**  
### **Machine Learning:**  
- **scikit-learn** for building and training the Linear Regression model.

### **Backend:**  
- **Flask** for serving the trained model and handling API requests.

### **Frontend:**  
- **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for designing and connecting the user interface.

## **Installation**  

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### **Prerequisites**  
- Python 3.8+ installed on your system.  
- Install Node.js for serving frontend files if required.  

### **Steps**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/RealEstatePricePrediction.git
   cd RealEstatePricePrediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. Install required Python dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the Flask backend:  
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open `index.html` in your browser or set up a local server for the frontend.

---

## **Usage**  

1. Open the application in your browser (default Flask server runs at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).  
2. Input the required property details in the form.  
3. Click on **Predict** to get the estimated price.
